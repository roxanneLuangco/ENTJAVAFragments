<!-- Description -->
<p class="first" style="font-size: 20px; font-style: giorgia; color: silver;">
Suddenly, a phone call was heard. 

The look on Matthew's face was so heart breaking. He's very worried about Sunny's whereabouts. 
He couldn't figure out why she would do this to him. His eyes were now filled with tears, but he's doing his best to keep them from falling. 

It was Sunny's number which appeared on his phone screen. Full of excitement to know that Sunny was calling, Matthew immediately answered the call. 
His face suddenly bloomed â€¦ but not too long, just as until when he heard someone else's voice. It was Sunny's maid.
